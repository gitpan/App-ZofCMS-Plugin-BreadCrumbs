App-ZofCMS-Plugin-BreadCrumbs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS>. It provides means to add
a "breadcrumbs" (L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)>)
to your pages.

This documentation assumes you've read L<App::ZofCMS>,
L<App::ZofCMS::Config> and L<App::ZofCMS::Template>

=head1 HOW DOES IT WORK

The plugin automagically generates breadcrumb links, if your sites are
relatively simple and pages are in good hierarchy the plugin will do
the Right Thing(tm) most of the time. The links for breadcrumbs are
determined as follows. If the page is not called C<index> then the
C<index> page in the current "directory" will be added to the breadcrumbs,
the "path" will be broken down to pieces and C<index> page in each piece
will be added to the breadcrumbs. B<Note:> the examples below assume
that the C<no_pages> argument was not specified:

    # page
    index.pl?page=/foo/bar/baz

    # crumbs
    /index => /foo/index => /foo/bar/index => /foo/bar/baz


    # page
    index.pl?page=/foo/bar/beer/index

    # crumbs
    /index => /foo/index/ => /foo/bar/index => /foo/bar/beer/index
